## Furry Discord Verification Bot

This bot is designed to manage a custom verification process for furry-themed Discord servers. It uses forms to collect information from users, then allows server moderators to review and either accept or reject the submissions. The verification process helps keep your community safe and ensures new members are a good fit.

### Key Features:
- **Automated form submission:** Users can fill out a form with details like their age, interests, and how they discovered the server.
- **Duplicate file check:** Automatically checks for duplicate media uploads during form submissions.
- **Moderation tools:** Provides moderators with action buttons to accept or reject applications directly from Discord.
- **Status tracking:** Each user’s submission is stored with a status that can be updated based on moderator decisions.
- **Persistent UI:** Allows users to start the verification process with the click of a button.
